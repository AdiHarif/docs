# Deno Deploy Quick Start

Deno Deploy is a globally distributed platform for serverless JavaScript
applications. Your JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly code runs on managed
servers geographically close to your users, enabling low latency and faster
response times. Deploy applications run on fast, light-weight
[V8 isolates](https://deno.com/blog/anatomy-isolate-cloud) rather than virtual
machines, powered by the [Deno runtime](/runtime/manual).

Let's deploy your first application - it should only take a few minutes. The
easiest way to get start with Deno Deploy is to use [our Playground
editor](https://dash.deno.com/playground/example-helloworld). Clicking that link
will drop you into Hello World application, you can click the Fork button  to
edit it.

The simplest Deno Deploy example is a web server that just returns a fixed
string for every response. It looks like this:

```js
Deno.serve(_req => {
  return new Response("Hello, World!");
});
```

This server can also be built locally and run with the `deno` command line
runtime. If we create a file called `server.ts` on your computer, and include
the source code above. Then you can test that it works by running it with the
command below:

```
deno run --allow-net server.ts
```

Your server should be viewable at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
Now let's run this code on the edge with Deno Deploy!

Of course there are more advanced ways to deploy servers on Deno Deploy using
Github Integration or the `deployctl` command line utility. Here's of the
different ways to deploy:

## Option 1: Start with a template to build a github repo

If you'd like to start out by deploying a pre-built template application, simply
[log in to the Deno Deploy dashboard](https://dash.deno.com) and click the "New
Project" button. You can choose to deploy a starter web application using
[Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev) or any of our supported web frameworks.

## Option 2: Start with an existing app

If you already have a Deno project hosted on GitHub, you can immediately import
it in Deno Deploy. [From the Deno Deploy dashboard](https://dash.deno.com),
click the "New Project" button and choose the option to "Select a repository".
Follow the on-screen instructions to deploy your existing application.

## Option 3: Start with a playground

As mentioned above, a [playground](./playgrounds.md) is a browser-based editor
that enables you to write and run JavaScript code right away. This is a great
choice for just kicking the tires on Deno and Deno Deploy! [From the Deno Deploy
dashboard](https://dash.deno.com), click the "New Project" button and choose any
of the options with a "Try with a playground" button.

## Option 4: Start from scratch

If you'd like to develop and deploy a simple application locally, use the
[`deployctl`](https://github.com/denoland/deployctl)
command line utility. To learn more about how to use `deployctl` to follow [the
instructions here](./deployctl.md).

## Next Steps

Now that you've created your first project, you can 
[check out the kinds of apps](./use-cases.md) you can run on Deploy. You could 
also skip right to [setting up your own custom domain](./custom-domains.md).
We're so excited to see what you'll ship with Deploy!
