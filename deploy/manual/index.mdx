# Deno Deploy Quick Start

Deno Deploy is a globally distributed platform for serverless JavaScript
applications. Your JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly code runs on managed
servers geographically close to your users, enabling low latency and faster
response times. Deploy applications run on fast, light-weight
[V8 isolates](https://deno.com/blog/anatomy-isolate-cloud) rather than virtual
machines, powered by the [Deno runtime](/runtime/manual).

Let's deploy your first application - it should only take a few minutes.

## Install Deno and `deployctl`

If you haven't already, you can
[install the Deno runtime](/runtime/manual/getting_started/installation)
using one of the commands below:

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="mac" label="macOS" default>

```sh
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh
```

</TabItem>
  <TabItem  value="windows" label="Windows">

```powershell
irm https://deno.land/install.ps1 | iex
```

</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

```sh
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

After Deno is installed, install the [`deployctl`](./deployctl.md) utility:

```
deno install -A jsr:@deno/deployctl
```

You can confirm `deployctl` has been installed correctly by running:

```
deployctl --help
```

Now, you're ready to deploy a Deno script from the command line!

## Write and test a Deno program

First, create a directory for the project and create a file called `main.ts` in it, with the
following "Hello World" web server:

```ts title="main.ts"
Deno.serve(() => new Response("Hello, world!"));
```

You can test that it works by running it with the command below:

```
deno run --allow-net main.ts
```

Your server should be viewable at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
Now let's run this code on the edge with Deno Deploy!

## Deploy!

From the directory of the `main.ts` file you just created, run this command:

```sh
deployctl deploy
```

You will be asked to authorize Deno Deploy in GitHub to sign up to Deno Deploy and/or to provision
an access token for `deployctl`. A few moments after that, your Hello World server will be
deployed in Deno Deploy infrastructure all around the world, ready to handle all the traffic you expect.

## Next Steps

Now that you've created your first deployment, you can [learn what kinds of apps](./use-cases.md)
you can run on Deno Deploy, check out [what else you can do with deployctl](./deployctl.md), or keep
reading to find out what other options you have to deploy your code to Deno Deploy. We're so
excited to see what you'll ship with Deno Deploy!

### Option 1: Start with a template

If you'd like to start out by deploying a pre-built template application, simply
[log in to the Deno Deploy dashboard](https://dash.deno.com) and click the "New
Project" button. You can choose to deploy a starter web application using
[Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev) or any of our supported web frameworks.

### Option 2: Start with an existing app

If you already have a Deno project hosted on GitHub, you can immediately import
it in Deno Deploy. [From the Deno Deploy dashboard](https://dash.deno.com),
click the "New Project" button and choose the option to "Select a repository".
Follow the on-screen instructions to deploy your existing application.

### Option 3: Start with a playground

A [playground](./playgrounds.md) is a browser-based editor that enables you to
write and run JavaScript code right away. This is a great choice for just
kicking the tires on Deno and Deno Deploy!
[From the Deno Deploy dashboard](https://dash.deno.com), click the "New Project"
button and choose any of the options with a "Try with a playground" button.
